# Iris-dataset-EDA

## Primary Goal: Predict Iris type given sepal length and width, and petal length and width.


### Steps:
1. Loading and wrangling dataset (this was fairly easy since the Iris dataset is pre-cleaned)
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), obtaining summary statistics, as well as gathering observations about how data looks.
3. Predictive modeling
